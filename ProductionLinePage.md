# Unity-as-a-production-line-simulator
A project I made in 2 weeks using Unity to create a simulation of a production line for doors and windows

## Motivation
This was created as a coding test for an interview. I incredibly enjoyed creating this project because I had to learn how to 
create and manage threads. I was also curious if I would be able to create this project on Unity because it isn't very thread friendly 
and is not necessarily designed for how I envisioned the project.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Unity](https://unity.com/)

## Features
  - Multi-threaded application
  
  - Door measurements are randomly generated to simulate orders
  
  - Calculates height and width of the window using door measurements. Windows are calculated differently depending on 3 different window types.
  
  - Constantly calculates the average measurements of finished doors and windows after each new addition
  
  - The speed of the lasers and products can be changed during runtime
  
  - Generates a report in a .txt file that lists each product information as well as the final averages of the measurements
